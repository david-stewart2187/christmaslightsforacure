                    <h2 class="section-heading">How many lights are in the show?</h2>
                    <p>It's difficult to put an exact number to it, but we estimate there are about 250,000 individual lights.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">How long have you guys been putting up lights?</h2>
                    <p>We've been doing our big "kick-off night" for about seven or eight years. However, we do have pictures of our lights from all the way back to 2013!</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Who puts up all the lights?</h2>
                    <p>David Stewart Sr. does most of the heavy lifting, but he enlists the help of his kids, extended family, and neighbors to put it all up and running.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Do you guys hire anyone to help out?</h2>
                    <p>Some people have asked this because some local companies put up advertisements highlighting their ability to put up Christmas lights near our show. Those are not our signs and we don't outsource any of the physical labor.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">How long does it take to set up?</h2>
                    <p>We start putting displays up at the start of November. From start to finish, it takes roughly thirty-five working days. If we're adding new displays, we may start as early as June or July to get displays tested and ready for December.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">How many man hours does it take?</h2>
                    <p>Man hours is a difficult thing to quantify, but it takes about 1200 total hours when you account for coding, setup, opening night, and ground-crew support.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">I just read the last response...what is ground-crew support?</h2>
                    <p>Our ground crew is made up of the volunteers mentioned in question three. Our ground-crew coordinators (Katherine Stewart, David Stewart Jr., and Matt Cannon) organize and oversee the efforts of volunteers to make sure everything is set up correctly.</p>
                    <p>When we say "ground-crew support", we're talking about the tireless hours put in (particularly by Brandi Stewart) to coordinate the logistics behind opening night and acquire resources to keep the ground-crew running.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">What happens with my donation and how much money have you guys raised?</h2>
                    <p>We've raised about $125,000 (including the current year) and every cent has gone to JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation).</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Why do you have a Santa mailbox?</h2>
                    <p>Santa lets us have a mailbox where everyone can drop off their letters to the North Pole. Our mailbox is right by the light tunnel on the corner of the street, and every letter that goes in gets delivered to Santa at the North Pole! </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">What if I have another question?</h2>
                    <p>If you have more questions, feel free to contact us through the email provided on the "contact" section of our website!</p>
